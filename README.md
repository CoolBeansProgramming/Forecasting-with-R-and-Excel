# Forecasting with R and Excel

Given historical data of U.S. dollar retail sales from January 1, 1992 - June 1, 2020, forecast the next eight months of retail sales per day using Excel and R.

In Excel, I will use FORECAST.ETS(). 

In R, I will primarily use the fpp2 for data analysis and to make forecasts. 


One concern is how or if this data set has accounted for the pandemic.
